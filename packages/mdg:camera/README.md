# Meteor Camera Package

Add it to your [Meteor](http://meteor.com) app with `meteor add mdg:camera`. The api is super simple - there is only one function to call:

### MeteorCamera.getPicture([options], callback)

Prompt the user to take a photo with their device and get the picture as a Data URI in JPEG format.

#### options

`options` is an optional argument that is an Object with the following possible keys:

- `width` An integer that specifies the minimum width of the returned photo.
- `height` An integer that specifies the minimum height of the returned photo.
- `quality` A number from 0 to 100 specifying the desired quality of JPEG encoding.

#### callback(error, data)

`callback` is a required argument that is a function that takes two arguments:

- `error` A [Meteor.Error](http://docs.meteor.com/#meteor_error) with a platform-specific error message.
- `data` A base64-encoded data URI for the image taken by the camera. This parameter can be used directly in the 'src' attribute of an image tag.
